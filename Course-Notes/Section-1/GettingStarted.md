<h2>What is Angular?</h2> 

Angular is two things. First and foremost, it's a frontend JavaScript framework, meaning that it's a collection of packages and guidelines to build web user interfaces.
However, Angular is also a collection of tools and features that can be used by developers to make the development process more dynamic and fluid. These tools include debugging tools, plug-ins for IDE's and code editors and a lot more.

<h2>Why use Angular?</h2> 
For trivial web applications and websites, Angular is not required at all. 
However, frameworks like Angular show their benefits during the development of complex, highly interactive web user interfaces. 
Angular simplifies this process by providing many useful features, rules and applied concepts. 

There are four main things that Angular brings to the table:

<ul>
  <li>You can write declarative code. As opposed to Vanilla JavaScript, written in imperative code. </li>
  <li>Separation of concerns into diferent Components, that can be reused and are independend from eachother.</li>
  <li>Object-oriented programming concepts and principles</li>
  <li>Use of TypeScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Angular's Evolution and Stability</h2>
The Angular team follows a versioning and release policy where a new major version is released around every 6 months. However, they do so in a manner that takes into consideration the aspect of backward compatibility and stability.
